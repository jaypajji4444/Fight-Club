## Description

Nowadays, sports has become all about analyzing your each and every move to get better and keeping that in mind, we created a portal where the UFC players can compare each and every move from their fights in each and every round. This also consists of a admin portal in which
the authorities can store medical records of the players on a protected Blockchain ledger with PoW difficulty level 4. The blood data of the players is also used to determine if they are involved in any kind of substance abuse which is calculated using an Ensemble model of SVM+Naive Bayes Classifier.
